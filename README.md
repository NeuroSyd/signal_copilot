BioSignal Copilot: Leveraging the power of LLMs in drafting reports for biomedical signals

Files and descriptions

- ECG_delineation.py This is a feasibility study code pack that aims to produce a Signal To Text for BioSignal Copilot system that we are developing. It contains the comprehensive code for our system.

- model.hdf5 is our predictive model, which is the model trained in

Test data: https://zenodo.org/record/3765780 ("Contain 827 ECG tracings from different patients, annotated by several cardiologists, residents and medical students. It is used as test set on the paper: "Automatic diagnosis of the 12-lead ECG using a deep neural network". https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15432-4.")

TNMG7_N1.dat and TNMG7_N1.hea are one of our case study test data.
TNMG7_N1_normal.png is the ECG picture corresponding to the test data.
